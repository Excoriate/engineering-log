# Engineering Log

A personal repository for engineering analysis, troubleshooting logs, technical documentation, and professional notes.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a structured knowledge base for:

- **Technical Analysis**: System architecture reviews, performance investigations, and design decisions
- **Troubleshooting Logs**: Debugging sessions, incident post-mortems, and problem-solving documentation
- **Engineering Notes**: Personal learnings, best practices, and professional development insights
- **Documentation Standards**: Cursor rules and markdown conventions for consistent technical writing

## Structure

```
engineering-log/
├── docs/                    # Structured documentation
│   └── 01_how_to/          # How-to guides and protocols
├── scratchpad/             # Working notes and drafts
│   ├── employers/          # Employer-specific notes
│   └── misc/               # Miscellaneous working files
└── .cursor/rules/          # Cursor IDE rules and conventions
```

## Documentation Standards

This repository follows consistent markdown formatting standards enforced through Cursor rules:

- **Markdown Conventions**: File naming, directory structure, code blocks, headers, spacing
- **Visual Aids**: Mermaid diagram standards and system visualization guidelines
- **System Thinking**: Holistic engineering analysis protocols emphasizing data-flow and causality

## Usage

### Adding New Content

1. **Structured Documentation**: Add to `docs/` following the established directory conventions
2. **Working Notes**: Use `scratchpad/` for temporary analysis and drafts
3. **Protocols**: Reference `docs/01_how_to/` for analysis and visualization guidelines

### Documentation Guidelines

- Follow markdown naming conventions (kebab-case for files, underscores for directories)
- Include YAML frontmatter for structured documents
- Use Mermaid diagrams for system visualizations
- Apply system thinking principles for technical analysis
