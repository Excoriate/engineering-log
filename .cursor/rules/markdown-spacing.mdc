# Markdown Spacing Standards

## Description

This rule enforces consistent spacing conventions around markdown elements including headers, code blocks, lists, and paragraphs. Proper spacing improves readability and ensures consistent rendering across markdown processors.

**Primary Focus**: Spacing consistency and blank line requirements

## Rule

**MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:**

1. **Header Spacing**
   - REQUIRED: Blank line after headers before content
   - REQUIRED: Blank line before headers (except first header in file)
   - Example: Header → blank line → content

2. **Code Block Spacing**
   - REQUIRED: Blank line before code blocks
   - REQUIRED: Blank line after code blocks (except at end of file)
   - Exception: Code blocks within list items follow list indentation rules

3. **Paragraph Spacing**
   - PROHIBITED: Multiple consecutive blank lines (max 1 blank line)
   - REQUIRED: Blank lines between paragraphs
   - No trailing whitespace at end of lines

4. **List Spacing**
   - REQUIRED: Blank line before list starts
   - REQUIRED: Blank line after list ends
   - OPTIONAL: Blank lines between list items (for multi-paragraph items)

5. **Indentation**
   - REQUIRED: Use spaces (not tabs) for indentation
   - REQUIRED: Consistent indentation levels (2 or 4 spaces)
   - Code blocks in lists: Indent to align with list item content

## Implementation

- Real-time spacing validation during editing
- Auto-formatting on save (optional)
- Visual indicators for spacing violations
- Batch formatting tool for entire files

## Benefits

1. **Readability**: Consistent spacing improves document scan ability
2. **Rendering**: Prevents markdown processor rendering issues
3. **Git Diffs**: Clean spacing reduces noise in version control
4. **Consistency**: Uniform appearance across all documentation

## Examples

### ✅ Correct Spacing

` ``markdown
# Header

This paragraph has proper spacing.

## Subheader

Content with blank line before.

` ``bash
echo "Code block with proper spacing"
` ``

Another paragraph after code block.

- List item 1
- List item 2

Content after list.
` ``

### ❌ Incorrect Spacing

` ``markdown
# Header
Content immediately after (NO BLANK LINE)

## Subheader


Multiple blank lines above (PROHIBITED)

` ``bash
echo "No blank line before"
` ``
Content immediately after code block

- List with no blank line before
- List item
Content immediately after list (NO BLANK LINE)
` ``

### Code Blocks in Lists (Special Case)

` ``markdown
✅ CORRECT:
- List item

  ` ``bash
  echo "Properly indented code block"
  ` ``

- Next list item

❌ INCORRECT:
- List item
` ``bash
echo "Code block not indented"
` ``
- Next list item
` ``

- [markdown-code-block-language.md](./markdown-code-block-language.md) - Code block formatting
- [markdown-formatting.md](./markdown-formatting.md) - Original combined rule (DEPRECATED)

## Pipeline Position

**Prerequisites**:
- [markdown-header-hierarchy.md](./markdown-header-hierarchy.md) - Headers must exist before spacing applied
- [markdown-code-block-language.md](./markdown-code-block-language.md) - Code blocks must exist before spacing applied

**Input Assumptions**:
- Markdown file has headers and content
- Code blocks and lists may be present

**Output Guarantees**:
- Blank lines before/after headers
- Blank lines before/after code blocks
- No multiple consecutive blank lines
- Consistent spacing throughout document

**Next Steps**:
- [markdown-cross-references.md](./markdown-cross-references.md) - Add cross-document links
